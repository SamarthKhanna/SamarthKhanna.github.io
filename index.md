## About Me

I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Informatics at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/), advised by Professor [Hadi Hosseini](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/hadi/) in the [Foundations of Artificial Intelligence Lab (FAIR)](https://sites.google.com/view/fairailab). My research investigates how large language models (LLMs) can serve as ethical decision-makers, with a focus on value alignment, procedural reasoning, and personalization. I study how well LLMs align with human moral and fairness judgments in collective decision-making domains such as resource allocation, kidney allocation, and matching markets; how reliably they can execute principled algorithms for aggregating preferences; and how they can be used to elicit individualsâ€™ moral values from noisy responses and provide personalized ethical advice. Through this work, I aim to build a foundation for designing AI systems that are not only powerful but also ethically reliable and socially aligned.

Before Penn State, I worked as a Software Developer (June 2022 to July 2023) with [Anchanto Pte Ltd.](https://www.anchanto.com/), where I was responsible for writing the Back-end, Data Pipelines, and for building Machine Learning-based services such as Product Matching and Text Analysis. Prior to that, I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Technology from [IIEST, Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/) in 2022. 

On a personal note, I'm into reading, theater, and debating. I've also played a number of sports and I always enjoy playing anything new.
