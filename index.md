## About Me

I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Informatics at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/). I work with Professor [Hadi Hosseini](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/hadi/) in the [Foundations of Artificial Intelligence Lab (FAIR)](https://sites.google.com/view/fairailab) on Algorithms to solve various problems in Computational Social Choice, Multi-agent interactions, and Game Theory. Currently, I am working on evaluating the social and economic behavior of Large Language Models.

Before Penn State, I worked as a Software Developer (June 2022 to July 2023) with [Anchanto Pte Ltd.](https://www.anchanto.com/), where I was responsible for writing the Back-end, Data Pipelines, and for building Machine Learning-based services such as Product Matching and Text Analysis. Prior to that, I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Technology from [IIEST, Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/) in 2022. 

On a personal note, I'm into reading, theater, and debating. I've also played a number of sports and I always enjoy playing anything new.
